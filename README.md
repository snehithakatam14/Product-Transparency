Reflection:
During this project, I actively used AI tools to guide my development workflow. Instead of starting from scratch, I leveraged ChatGPT to generate boilerplate code for both backend and frontend. This included setting up Express routes, configuring MongoDB schemas, and building React components to fetch, display, and manage product data. AI also helped debug common issues, such as CORS errors, incorrect environment variable usage, and deployment challenges on Vercel and Render. By asking targeted questions, I was able to iterate quickly and focus on integration rather than spending hours searching through documentation.
The principles guiding my architecture and design were simplicity, transparency, and usability. The backend was kept minimalistic with RESTful APIs, ensuring CRUD operations could be extended easily in the future. The frontend prioritized user experience — providing clear product listings and easy export options (CSV/PDF). The product transparency logic was built to allow users not only to view products but also to export and share reports, aligning with the project’s core goal: making product information more accessible and transparent.
